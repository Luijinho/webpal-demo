Create a webpage that allows users to set a countdown timer. Users should be able to enter a duration in seconds and start the countdown by clicking the 'Start' button. The countdown should decrement every second and display the remaining time. Implement a 'Pause' button that pauses the countdown, and a 'Reset' button that stops the countdown and resets it to zero. The countdown timer should stop automatically when it reaches zero.
